## Why Architecture Matters

As applications grow, a well-thought-out architecture becomes crucial for maintainability, scalability, and team productivity.

## Key Principles

### 1. Component Design

Keep components:

- **Small and focused**: Single responsibility principle
- **Reusable**: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **Testable**: Easy to unit test in isolation

### 2. State Management

Choose the right tool for your needs:

- **Local state**: React hooks (useState, useReducer)
- **Global state**: Context API for simple cases
- **Complex state**: Consider Redux, Zustand, or Jotai

### 3. Code Organization

Structure your project logically:

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── features/       # Feature-specific code
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── lib/            # Utilities and helpers
└── types/          # TypeScript definitions
```

## Performance Optimization

1. **Code splitting**: Use dynamic imports
2. **Lazy loading**: Load components on demand
3. **Memoization**: Use React.memo and useMemo
4. **Virtual scrolling**: For long lists

## Testing Strategy

Implement a comprehensive testing pyramid:

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and hooks
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E tests**: Test critical user flows

## Conclusion

A solid frontend architecture pays dividends as your application scales. Invest time upfront in planning your structure and patterns.
