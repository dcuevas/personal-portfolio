export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title');
  // Save to database
}
```

### 3. Improved Performance

Next.js 15 includes:

- Faster builds with Turbopack
- Optimized image loading
- Better code splitting
- Improved caching strategies

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Conclusion
