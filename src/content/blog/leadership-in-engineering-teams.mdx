## The Servant Leadership Philosophy

As an engineering leader, your primary role is to enable your team to do their best work by removing obstacles and providing support.

## Core Principles

### 1. Empowering Teams

Give teams autonomy to make decisions:

- Let them choose their tools and technologies
- Trust them to estimate and plan their work
- Encourage experimentation and learning

### 2. Continuous Improvement

Foster a culture of learning:

- Regular retrospectives
- Blameless post-mortems
- Knowledge sharing sessions
- Pair programming and code reviews

### 3. Clear Communication

Ensure everyone understands:

- **Why**: The business context and goals
- **What**: Clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- **How**: Technical approach and trade-offs

## Building Team Culture

### Psychological Safety

Create an environment where team members feel safe to:

- Ask questions
- Admit mistakes
- Propose new ideas
- Challenge decisions respectfully

### Recognition and Growth

- Celebrate wins, both big and small
- Provide constructive feedback
- Support career development
- Create growth opportunities

## Balancing Technical and People Work

As you move into leadership:

1. **Stay technical**: Keep coding, but less
2. **Delegate effectively**: Trust your team
3. **Focus on impact**: Prioritize high-leverage activities
4. **Be available**: Make time for your team

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Scaling Yourself

**Solution**: Build systems and processes that work without you. Document decisions, create runbooks, and empower others to lead.

### Challenge: Conflicting Priorities

**Solution**: Transparent prioritization frameworks. Involve stakeholders early and communicate trade-offs clearly.

## Conclusion

Servant leadership isn't about being softâ€”it's about being effective. By putting your team first, you create an environment where great work happens naturally.
